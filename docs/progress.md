# 📊 Your DevOps Workshop Progress Tracker

<div class="workshop-callout">
  <div class="workshop-callout-title">🎯 Important: This is Your First DevOps Task!</div>
  <p><strong>Editing this page IS practicing the Code phase!</strong> You'll fork this repo, edit this tracker with your personal information, commit your changes, and create a Pull Request. This teaches you Git workflows while tracking your progress.</p>
</div>

## How Progress Tracking Works in This Workshop

**Meta-Learning Approach**: This progress tracker serves dual purposes:
1. **Learning Tool**: Editing it teaches Git workflows (Code phase)
2. **Assessment Tool**: Tracking completion of all 5 DevOps phases

<div class="tip-box">
💡 <strong>Your First Assignment:</strong> After completing setup, you'll personalize the sections below with your information and commit the changes. This practices collaborative development through Git!
